# Quicksort-Project  
This C++ program processes well data from a file, performs sorting based on flow rates, and outputs the results. The program consists of three main classes: 'GasWell', 'WellData', and the main application.

# GasWell Class  

The 'GasWell' class represents a gas well and includes methods for adding well data, sorting wells based on flow rates using the QuickSort Algorithm, and printing sorted well data.

Public Methods:

'GasWell()': Default constructor  
'GasWell(const string& name)': Constructor with a specified well name  
'void addWellData(const WellData& data)': Adds well data to the well  
'const vector<WellData>& getWellData() const': Retrieves well data  
'int partition(vector<GasWell>& wells, int low, int high)': Partition the wells for QuickSort  
'void quicksortFlowToTemp(vector<GasWell>& wells, int low, int high)': Sort wells based on flow rates  
'void printSortedWells(const vector<GasWell>& wells)': Prints sorted well data  

Public Members:

'string wellName': Name of the gas well  
'vector<WellData> WellInfo': Vector containing well data  

# WellData Class  

The 'WellData' class represents daily data for a gas well, including flow, pressure, and temperature.

Public Methods:

'WellData()': Default constructor  
'WellData(int f, int p, int temp)': Constructor with specified flow, pressure, and temperature  

Public Members:

'int flow': Flow rate of the well  
'int pressure': Pressure of the well  
'int temperature': Temperature of the well  

# Main Application  

The main application reads well data from a file, populates a map of gas wells, and displays the imported data. It then converts the map data to a vector, sorts the vector based on flow rates using the 'quicksortFlowToTemp' method, and prints the sorted well data.

Dependencies:

"\<iostream\>"  
"\<fstream\>"  
"\<sstream\>"  
"\<map\>"  
"GasWell.h"  

Execution:

Open the "10000_random_wells.txt" for input.
Process the well data and display the imported data.
Sort the wells based on flow rates.
Display the sorted well data.
